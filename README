Welcome to Spectre 3! 
Spectre is a secure, end-to-end encrypted chat program designed with security as a first priority.
With Spectre3, we've moved away from python2 and rewritten the program in python3, and taken the opportunity to rewrite the project better than ever.
Spectre now includes more robust encryption, a new AES mode (We are now using CTR instead of CBC), better key generation, and a better user interface. Using Spectre has never been as easy or as safe. 
Enjoy privacy, the easy way.

Installation and Setup:
Spectre was designed to be easy to setup and use. To get started, simply run:

1) Install requirements. This can be done by running:
$pip3 install -r requirements
If this does not work, try
python3 -m pip install -r requirements
If on windows, ensure you are running this command from an elevated command prompt

2) Run spectre.
$python3 spectre.py
